# House Targaryen

A web application built to explore the lineage of House Targaryen from _A Song of Ice and Fire_ by George R.R. Martin. I built this to help navigate the wild, tangled web of this house, because letâ€™s be real: the Targaryens have _a lot_ going on! This app brings their history to life in a terminal-themed interface.

## Technologies

- **Flask**: Python web framework for routing and rendering.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing Targaryen data, relationships, and dragons.
- **CSS**: Vanilla CSS, with a terminal aesthetic.

## Views

- **Targaryen List**: A paginated list of all Targaryens with sorting options (alphabetical, lineage, oldest to youngest, youngest to oldest).
- **Individual Profiles**: Detailed profiles for each Targaryen.
- **Dragons List**: A detailed list of dragons.
- **Relationships**: Displays parent-child and spouse relationships (Targaryen-Targaryen and Targaryen-Non-Targaryen).
- **Search**: Search functionality to find Targaryens by name.
